This project has been created on top of generatrix.

It is eerily similar in functionality to http://github.com/talonx/book-search.
The only difference is that this project uses PHP instead of Ruby and it uses my own framework.

The actual value proposition would be the ability to buy ebooks. But we'll get to that after we have hard covers.
